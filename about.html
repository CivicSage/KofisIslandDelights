        <h1>About Kofi's Island Delights</h1>
        <img src="kofi-image.jpg" alt="Kofi at his shaved ice stand" class="about-image">
        <p>Kofi, a passionate 9-year-old entrepreneur, launched Kofi's Island Delights with the support of his dad. His goal is to save money for video games, his college fund, and future passions.</p>
        <p>We hope to sell shaved ice from Kofi's dad's home in Sellwood, near the Sellwood pool, and attend various events in Oregon.</p>
        <p>Our business was launched at this year's Eugene Juneteenth Event, where we felt the incredible support from the black community and the love for Kofi's young entrepreneurial vision. It was a huge success - we sold out on the first day, serving nearly 100 shaved ice cones!</p>
        <p>The joy on children's faces as they enjoyed Kofi's Island Delights was priceless. We estimate that we made over 80 children smile with our delicious treats, creating lasting memories and spreading happiness throughout the event.</p>
